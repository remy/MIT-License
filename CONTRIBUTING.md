# Contributing

This project is PHP based but may one day move to node (as this is my preferred development language).

If you are a collaborator (with push permissions), you can merge any open PR with the following conditions:

1. It passes the JSON validity test (this is a github integration in travis)
2. Merge anything that adds or updates a `<user>.json` file

If you're unsure, cc @remy into the PR with a question and we can work out what to do.

The site is hosted on heroku and will automatically deploy merges into master, which means once a PR is merged, it'll be live shortly thereafter (so there's nothing to do ðŸŽ‰).

Also, thank you, your help is appreciated ðŸ’™
